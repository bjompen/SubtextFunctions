# SubtextFunctions
Functions for importing and exporting subtext files (.srt)

Still very Alpha.

Mostly a project to get myself to try out classes,

but if someone finds it usefull, go ahead.

Todo
* nicer way to find text start and stopline in ConvertFrom-Subtitle
* Create class(es) for subtitles
    * $SubObject.AddSeconds(5) # should move entire subtitle five seconds forward.
* ConvertTo-subtitle
* Pester tests 
* Add support for other formats, WebVTT and TTML maybe?
